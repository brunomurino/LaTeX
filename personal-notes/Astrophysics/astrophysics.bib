abstract = {It has been reported recently that there are some early-type spiral (Sa{\^{a}}Sab) galaxies with evident star-forming regions that concentrate in their own central 1 kpc. In such central region, is the mechanism of the star formation distinct from that in disks of spiral galaxies? To discover this, we estimate the star formation efficiency (SFE) in this central 1 kpc star-forming region of some early-type spiral galaxies, taking account of the condition required for this 1 kpc region to be self-gravitating. Using two indicators of the present star formation rate (H{\^{I}}± and infrared luminosity), we estimate the SFE to a few percent. This is equivalent to the observational SFE in the disks of late-type spiral (Sb{\^{a}}) galaxies. This coincidence may support the universality of the mean SFE of spiral galaxies reported in the recent studies, that is, we find no evidence of a distinct mechanism of the star formation in the central 1 kpc region of early-type galaxies. Also, we examine the structure of the central star-forming region and discuss a method for estimating the mass of star-forming regions.},

@article{Read2005,
abstract = {In the Big Bang about 5{\%} of the mass that was created was in the form of normal baryonic matter (neutrons and protons). Of this about 10{\%} ended up in galaxies in the form of stars or of gas (that can be in molecules, can be atomic, or can be ionised). In this work, we measure the baryonic mass function of galaxies, which describes how the baryonic mass is distributed {\{}$\backslash$it within{\}} galaxies of different types (e.g. spiral or elliptical) and of different sizes. This can provide useful constraints on our current cosmology, convolved with our understanding of how galaxies form. This work relies on various large astronomical surveys, for example the optical Sloan Digital Sky Survey (to observe stars) and the HIPASS radio survey (to observe atomic gas). We then perform an integral over our mass function to determine the cosmological density in baryons in galaxies: {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}{\{}\backslashrm b, gal{\}} = 0.0035{\$}. Most of these baryons are in stars: {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}{\{}*{\}} = 0.0028{\$}. Only about 20{\%} are in gas. The error on the quantities, as determined from the range obtained between different methods, is {\$}\backslashsim 10{\$}{\%}; systematic errors may be much larger. Most ({\$}\backslashsim 90{\$}{\%}) of the baryons in the Universe are not in galaxies. They probably exist in a warm/hot intergalactic medium. Searching for direct observational evidence and deeper theoretical understanding for this will form one of the major challenges for astronomy in the next decade.},
